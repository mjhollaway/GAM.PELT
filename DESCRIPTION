Description: This a spatiotemporal changepoint method that utilises a generalised additive model (GAM) dependent 
             on the 2D spatial location and the observation time to account for the underlying 
             spatio-temporal process. The full likelihood of the GAM is used in conjunction with 
             the Pruned Linear Exact Time (PELT) changepoint search algorithm to detect multiple 
             changepoints across spatial locations in a computationally efficient manner.
